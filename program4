	Program 4				CS570 Fall 2016

	TWO deadlines will be listed in ~cs570/calendar, since you can get
	25% extra credit if you finish a week early.

In this assignment, you will enhance the C program called p2, which acts as a
simple command line interpreter for our UNIX system.  Your activity for this
assignment should initially take place in a directory called ~/Two and your
main program should initially be in a file called ~/Two/p2.c .  (Note that
we are reusing the same directory from a prior project.)

Your source files must be in the designated directories (and named
properly) at the time the automatic grading programs measure your performance.
Ultimately, your main program should be in a file called ~/Two/p2.c
(along with a modified getword.c) so that ~/Two/makefile can successfully
create an executable file called ~/Two/p2 from your source.

--> Specifications <--

You are responsible for two main enhancements [as well as ensuring that all
the stuff from the program2 specs work]: allowing multiple pipelines and
setting/printing environment variables.

Your program should prompt for input with the four-character string
"p2: "

Every line of input will consist of 0 or more "words", where a word is defined
to agree with the specifications for program 1, with one exception:
We are now giving special treatment to the character '$', but only when it
occurs as the first character in a word (and we will NOT be splitting '$' off
into a separate word; see below).

p2 skips input lines that contain 0 words, and simply reissues the prompt.

p2 terminates when it sees an input line whose first word is the end of file
marker [EOF].  The metacharacters "<", ">", "|", leading "$", and trailing "&"
have special significance to your shell; see below.

For other inputs, p2 tries to interpret the first word as the name of an
executable file.  (Helpful error messages should be produced if the file does
not exist or is not executable -- and your shell should not crash.)  The
remaining words, after interpreting the metacharacters, are treated as the
arguments for that executable file.  A new process is created to execute the
file, and the parent [usually] waits for this process to complete.

Your shell must be able to handle redirection of I/O, using the words
"<", ">", and "|" as in the usual shells.  For example, if "spell" were a
spelling checker program, you could use it to scan a file in "Proj/mytext"
and put the results in file "/tmp/dumberrors", by typing:
spell < Proj/mytext > /tmp/dumberrors
Note: Since getword() already uses metacharacters to separate words,
the following would have exactly the same effect:
spell<Proj/mytext>/tmp/dumberrors
Note: The following is also equivalent:
< Proj/mytext > /tmp/dumberrors spell
...and, after processing the redirection directives, "spell" would still be
considered the 'first' word of the command line.

Like 'real' shells,
c1 > file1 > file2
should be flagged as an error (your program is never required to redirect
output to two places at once), and [since this is ambiguous syntax] your p2
should NOT attempt to carry out the command.
Note that the following is NOT an error:
< fileB > fileA command1 | process2
(since there is a rational interpretation for this with no ambiguity:
command1 will read from fileB and write to the pipe, while process2 will
read from the pipe and write to fileA).  Note that, like 'real' shells,
our idea of the 'first' word on the line is really a bit complicated to
state precisely: we actually execute the first word that is not associated
with a redirection metacharacter ('command1' in this example).  The simple rule
is: the effects of '< fileB' is always applied to the first process, and the
effects of '> fileA' is always applied to the last [and sometimes only] process.

As before, an '&' will cause p2 to start a new process to execute the
binary, print out the PID of that process in the specific format described
in program2, and continue without waiting for the completion of the child.
(See the program2 specs for full details -- it does not do anything special
with the '&' unless it is the LAST word on the command line.)

Your p2 should handle the cd(1) command correctly as in program 2 (as a built-in,
without forking a child), along with an additional builtin called 'environ'.
environ accepts 1 or 2 arguments (any other number should be reported as an
error).  Call with one argument,
environ HOME
...should cause the current value of your $HOME environment variable to appear
on stdout (followed by a newline).
environ snafubar
...should print a null string followed by a newline (assuming there is no such
environment variable with that goofy name).
environ can also accept two arguments, in which case it SETS the value of the
variable (rather than merely printing it).  For example,
environ SHELL /bin/bash
...should cause the string "HOME=/bin/bash" to replace the current definition of
SHELL in your u-struct area.  (So subsequently,
environ SHELL
from then on would print "/bin/bash" rather than the usual "/bin/csh" definition.
This is similar to the effect you would get in a 'real' shell, such as executing
printenv SHELL  ;  setenv SHELL /bin/bash  ;  printenv SHELL
from your 'rohan[46]% ' prompt.)
Note that if you feed a shell that meets the program4 specs the three lines:
environ HOME /tmp
cd
pwd
...then pwd should report "/tmp" since you [should have] designed cd with
no arguments to change your current working directory to the current value
that is stored in the HOME environment variable, which had already been
changed to "/tmp".  NOTE: 'real' shells allow built-in commands in pipelines
(such as 'printenv HOME | tr a-z A-Z'), but p2 does NOT have to worry about
handling 'environ' within a pipeline.

Your program4 shell gives special significance to the character '$', but only
when it occurs as the first character in a word (normal shells pay attention
to '$' no matter where it occurs, but we want to keep things simple here).
If '$' is first, replace the word with whatever the value of the given
environment variable is.  For example, if the command line input is:
echo $PAGER $EDITOR
...you will set up the argv array for the forked child as though it had been:
echo /usr/ucb/more /usr/ucb/vi
(or whatever the values of the environment variables happen to be at the time).
For environment variables that don't exist, do what your shell does, e.g.:
rohan[46]% echo $snafubar
snafubar: Undefined variable.
(Note that NO child is forked in this case, since the command was not parsable.
For simplicity, treat an environment variable that exists but is null as though
it were nonexistent.)  If you react to the '$' as specified, you should be
pleasantly surprised that things like
$PAGER /htaccess > $USER
will work without you have to even think about dealing with special cases.
In the above, /usr/ucb/more will run and its output (the contents of /htaccess)
will wind up in a file created by your p2, named with your username.
Note that "$HOME" causes a string replacement very similar to what your
shell does when it encounters "~".

If you've followed the getword.h specs correctly,
echo \$VENDOR $VENDOR my$VENDOR
will print
$VENDOR sun my$VENDOR 
Note that the negative values that getword() returns will make it easy for
parse() to distinguish between these cases.

You will find that some design decisions have been left to your discretion.
In those cases, any reasonable behavior is acceptable, but when there is
ambiguity in the command line, always report that as an error.  For example,
a.out < infile1 < infile2
is ambiguous.  Are you supposed to read from the first file specified,
read from the second file specified, or what?  In cases like these, mimic
what all other UNIX shells do: take NO action, but report an error.

See me if you have any questions about exactly what p2 can do.

--> Implementation <--

The p2 project should contain the following files, each in the
subdirectory ~/Two.  (You should see me if you think you need more files.)
Most of these files should already have been set up in the second project;
you will mostly be modifying files that already exist.

p2 -- the executable program

gradernotes -- a mandatory text file in which you must state FIRST that 
	"I wrote this code myself," or list all sources from which you borrowed.
	SECOND, that either your project has no known bugs or outline its
	known shortcomings.  This may be FOLLOWED by any comments you wish
	to communicate to the grader.

makefile -- create this via the command:
	ln -s ~cs570/Two/makefile ~/Two/makefile

p2.h -- common header information for the C source files in your
	program.  Here are some things that should be in p2.h:
#include <stdio.h>
#include "getword.h"
#define MAXITEM 100 /* max number of words per line */

getword.h -- header file for the function getword()  Create this by:
	cd ~/Two
	ln -s ~cs570/One/getword.h

	Your code from Program 1 will need only slight modifications for
	the p2 in Program 4.
	Note that getword() doesn't know about the special significance
	of "|", ">", "<", and "&".  As in Program1, getword() simply
	assembles them in an array just like any other "words".
	them in an array just like any other "words".

p2.c -- source code for everything but the getword() routine.
	See: getenv(3c), setenv(3c), fflush(3c), fork(2), chmod(2), perror(3c),
	dup2(3c), open(2), wait(3c), stat(2), pipe(2), exit(3c), chdir(2),
	signal(3c), and killpg(3c).
	Typing
	whatis wait
	...will show six different man pages for wait, most of which are not
	relevant to this assignment.  The numbers shown above in parentheses
	refer to the manual section number you actually want, e.g.,
	man -s 3c wait
	will show the Section Three-C manual page for wait().  Note that use
	of execvp() should eliminate path search complications.  You are not
	allowed to use system(3c).  You are NOT allowed to use any type of
	exec call other than execvp().

p2 should make use of a separate routine, parse(), that is only responsible
for the syntactic analysis.  Therefore, p2.c will contain at least two
Some of the grade-testing may depend on the degree to which parse()
follows its specification precisely.  Please ask me if you have any
questions about this spec.  Here are the design specifications for parse:

All syntactic analysis should be done within parse().  This means, among
other things, that parse() should set appropriate flags when getword()
encounters words that are metacharacters.  You may be graded off if your
routines are ill-designed or do not adhere to the requirements.  Examples
of poor design: calling parse() more than once per command, or having
getword() set the flags rather than doing this within parse().
parse() must use something like the getword() function you wrote in
Program 1, but modified to treat '|' as a metacharacter.  Examining the
file ~cs570/Two/makefile may be helpful in determining how to link it into
your program.

Here is a rough outline for p2.  While this is not to be taken as religiously
as the other parts of this assignment, you must:
  use getword() for all program input;
  ensure that background jobs cannot read from the terminal (redirecting
  input to come from /dev/null is one way);
  ensure that cd and environ will properly affect subsequent
  commands to p2.

     #include statements
     #define statements
     declarations;

     main()
     {
           declarations of locals;

           any necessary set-up, including signal catcher;
           for (;;) {
                issue PROMPT;
                call your parse function;
                if (first word is EOF) break;
                if (line is empty) continue;
                handle builtins (cd, environ) and continue, or: 
                set up for any redirection (background children should
                have their stdin redirected to /dev/null);
                if (fork() == 0) {
                       redirect I/O as requested;
                       use execvp() to start requested process;
                       if the execvp() failed {
                            print an error message;
                            exit(9);
                       }
                }
                if appropriate, wait for child to complete;
                else print the child's pid.
           }
           killpg(getpid(), SIGTERM); // Terminate any children that are
                                      // still running. WARNING: giving bad args
                                      // to killpg() can kill the autograder!
           printf("p2 terminated.\n");// MAKE SURE this printf comes AFTER killpg
           exit(0);
     }

Note: When your normal shell (tcsh) finds that one of its children has been
killed by a signal, it reports:
Terminated
(note the capital 'T').  Indeed, tcsh will do this when p2 is killed (as it
should be) by the killpg() function.  Do not view this as a flaw in p2 and
try to fix it (you can't, since p2 is not the process printing that 'T'!)
link it into your program.

--> Delivery <--

The automatic grading program may print every .c and .h file, so please do
not leave extraneous files in ~/Two (it may be convenient to store such files
in ~/Two/Ignore or some other directory).  The automatic grader will also
print ~/Two/gradernotes.  You must not change any of these after the grading
program has been run.  Please don't make any of your files public!

Your final suite of files must be capable of producing an executable p2 by
typing nothing more than
make
when the current directory is ~/Two.

The file called ~/Two/gradernotes is intended to be read by a human
grader. It should contain any notes that you want the grader to
read.  ~/Two/gradernotes *must* contain an initial statement certifying that
"I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions", or else you must
point out (and try to explain) places where your p2 does not meet the specs
(or any commands that don't work).  If the failure is due to an underlying
weakness of the specs, explain how the problem might be fixed.  If your
program only works under very special conditions, you must support your
contention that it works at all by including script session(s) at the end
of ~/Two/gradernotes in which you test your p2.

The file called ~/Two/GradeEarly (note the odd capitalization) is intended
to signal that you have completed the project a week early, and wish to
take advantage of the extra credit reward.  The contents of the file are
immaterial; the autograder will only test for the existence of this file.
If the file has been created by the 125% deadline, your project will be
picked up for grading at that time (so no further changes to your code or
documentation will be possible).  Your score will be augmented by 25% (for
example, if you would have normally received 75% of the points, you will
instead qualify for 94% of the points possible).
